Slick is a lightweight clone of [Slack](https://www.slack.com), a popular chat application for businesses. Each business has a single workspace â€” a collection of topic-specific chatrooms called channels. Users can join multiple workspaces and contribute messages to multiple channels. Users can also have private conversations with other users. Messages may contain text, images or file attachments.

## Technologies
